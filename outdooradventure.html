    <h2>Hiking</h2>


  <img id="hiking1" src="images/hiking150/hikingmountains150.jpg" alt="hikingmoutains"/>
    <p id="hikingparagraph">

      In the United States, Canada, the Republic of Ireland,
    and United Kingdom, hiking means walking outdoors on a trail,
    or off trail, for recreational purposes. A day hike refers to a
    hike that can be completed in a single day. However, in the United
    Kingdom, the word walking is also used, as well as rambling, while
    walking in mountainous areas is called hillwalking. In Northern
    England, Including the Lake District and Yorkshire Dales,
    fellwalking describes hill or mountain walks, as fell is the
    common word for both features there.
  </p>

  <p>

    Hiking sometimes involves bushwhacking and is sometimes referred to
    as such. This specifically refers to difficult walking through dense
    forest, undergrowth, or bushes, where forward progress requires pushing
     vegetation aside. In extreme cases of bushwhacking, where the
      vegetation is so dense that human passage is impeded, a machete is
      used to clear a pathway. The Australian term bushwalking refers to
      both on and off-trail hiking. Common terms for hiking used by New
      Zealanders are tramping (particularly for overnight and longer trips)
      , walking or bushwalking. Trekking is the preferred word used to
      describe multi-day hiking in the mountainous regions of India,
      Pakistan, Nepal, North America, South America, Iran, and the
      highlands of East Africa. Hiking a long-distance trail from
      end-to-end is also referred to as trekking and as thru-hiking
      in some places. In North America, multi-day hikes, usually with
      camping, are referred to as backpacking.

<h2> Canoeing</h2>
<p>
Canoeing is an activity which involves paddling a canoe with a single-bladed paddle.
 Common meanings of the term are limited to when the canoeing is the central purpose of
 the activity. Broader meanings include when it is combined with other activities such as
 canoe camping, or where canoeing is merely a transportation method used to accomplish other
 activities. Most present-day canoeing is done as or as a part of a sport or recreational activity.
 In some parts of Europe canoeing refers to both canoeing and kayaking, with a canoe being called an open canoe.
</p>
<p>
Canoes are widely used for competition and pleasure, such as racing, whitewater, touring and camping,
freestyle, and general recreation. Canoeing has been part of the Olympics since 1936. The intended use of
the canoe dictates its hull shape and length and construction material. Historically, canoes were dugouts or
made of bark on a wood frame, but construction materials evolved to canvas on a wood frame, then to aluminum.
Most modern canoes are made of molded plastic or composites such as fiberglass.
</p>
<p>
Canoes were developed by cultures all over the world, including some designed for use with sails or outriggers.
Until the mid-1800s the canoe was an important means of transport for exploration and trade, and in some places
it still is used as such, perhaps with the addition of an outboard motor. Where the canoe played a key role in
history, such as the northern United States, Canada, and New Zealand, it remains an important theme in popular
culture.
